# tablInspector

No, the name has no typo. 'tabl' is a keyword in the Online Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS). It classifies a sequence as a regular triangular array of numbers.

The goal of this library is to identify semantically meaningful clusters around integer triangles, to implement these triangles, and to provide tools to study them.

The implementations are written in annotated Python and refer to a uniform interface.

An integer triangle is a list of integer lists (list[list[int]]). As usual in Python, all lists are 0-based; in particular, all triangles have offset = 0.

This allows us to identify an integer triangle with a list whose indexing is like this:

```
[ [(0,0)], [(1,0), (1,1)], [(2,0), (2,1), (2,2)], ..., [(n,0), (n,1), ... (n,k), ... (n,n)] ]
```

For example, G. W. Leibniz wrote down a number triangle in his "Dissertatio de arte combinatoria", Leipzig in 1666, that we will display like this:

```
    [0]    [0]
    [1]    [0,   1]
    [2]    [0,   2,    2]
    [3]    [0,   3,    4,   3]
    [4]    [0,   4,    6,   6,    4]
    [5]    [0,   5,    8,   9,    8,    5]
    [6]    [0,   6,   10,  12,   12,   10,    6]
    [7]    [0,   7,   12,  15,   16,   15,   12,    7]
    [8]    [0,   8,   14,  18,   20,   20,   18,   14,   8]
    [9]    [0,   9,   16,  21,   24,   25,   24,   21,  16,  9]
```

The first (left) column indicates the row number and is not part of the triangle.

To use the library, put the file Tables.py in the same directory where your project is or somewhere else where the interpreter can find it. 
Make sure your Python has the "more_itertools" package installed. The other Python files are not needed as long as you do not want to make your own additions to the library.

Test the installation.

 ### Example 1

```
    from Tables import TablesListPreview
    TablesListPreview()
```

This shows the list of the sequences implemented.

To use a Table from the library:

 ### Example 2

```
    from Tables import Abel, InspectTable
    InspectTable(Abel)
```

Use the Table as an iterable:

### Example 3

```
    AbelRows = Abel.itr(7)
    for row in AbelRows:
        print(row, 'sum:', sum(row))
```

# The methods

Currently, 116 triangles are included in this library implementing the class `Table` that provides the following methods:

```
    __call__(self, n: int, k: int) -> int | T(n, k)
    val (n:int, k:int)   -> int  | T(n, k)
    row (n: int)         -> trow | n-th row of table
    itr (size: int)      -> Iterator[list[int]] | traverse the first 'size' rows
    flat (size: int)     -> list[int] | flattened form of the first size rows
    diag(n, size: int)   -> list[int] | diagonal starting at the left side
    col (k, size: int)   -> list[int] | k-th column starting at the main diagonal
    sum (size: int)      -> list[int] | sums of the first size rows
    antidiag (size: int) -> list[int] | upward anti-diagonals
    rev (size: int)      -> trow | reversed rows
    acc (size: int)      -> trow | accumulated row 
    alt (size: int)      -> trow | alternating signs 
    diff (size: int)     -> trow | first difference of row
    der (size: int)      -> trow | derivative of row
    tab (size: int)      -> tabl | table with size rows
    mat (size: int)      -> tabl | matrix form of lower triangular array
    inv (size: int)      -> tabl | inverse table
    revinv (size: int)   -> tabl | row reversed inverse
    invrev (size: int)   -> tabl | inverse of row reversed
    off (N: int, K: int) -> rgen | new offset (N, K)
    revinv11 (size: int) -> tabl | revinv from offset (1, 1)
    invrev11 (size: int) -> tabl | invrev from offset (1, 1)
    poly(n: int, x: int) -> int  | sum(T(n, k) * x^j for j=0..n)
    trans(s: seq, size)  -> list[int] | linear transformation induced by T
    invtrans(s: seq, size) -> list[int] | inverse transformation induced by T
    show (size: int)     -> None | prints the first 'size' rows with row-numbers
```

These methods provide various functionalities for manipulating and generating integer triangles.
For example, the row method returns the n-th row of the triangle, the rev method returns the reversed row of the triangle, and the antidiag method returns the n-th antidiagonal of the triangle.


# Triangles as semantically meaningful clusters in the database.

This project aimed to identify the crucial triangles without relying on subjective assessment. For this, a metric had to be developed. 
We based the ranking on the number of distinct sequences generated by a fixed pool of elementary transformations mapping the triangles to other sequences. 
These transformations are called 'table traits' and are implemented in the module '_tabltraits'.


In this way, we found that each of the 50 most highly ranked triangles generates, on average, 35 distinct related sequences registered in the OEIS. 
Thus, a high rank means the triangle is a significant structural component in the OEIS database and binds seemingly unrelated sequences into a semantically meaningful cluster. The top triangles are listed below.
